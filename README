This repo contains some structured examples on how to scope and then implement a generic project approach.
It is intended to be a 'soup to nuts' case study - i.e. something that can be applied to the start of a project and then provide the required planning, outputs and activity to enable the project to be conducted.
It is based on a fictional use case - A made-up UK based Technology Start Up called 'Zen Cycle'.  Zen Cycle has a product called 'ZenAI' this is being used to help apply Artificial Intelligence to improve the supply chain and logistics for Bicycle Shops.
The planning outputs provided here are derived from a grant application for a funding agency known as UK Innovate (here - https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/2141/overview/0b4e5073-a63c-44ff-b4a7-84db8a92ff9f)
Referencing a real life funding opportunity with a fictional use case, has allowed the production of some practical use cases of where and how Project Management supports this activity
